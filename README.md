# tractor-beam ðŸ›¸

An application for synchronising key-value data from a spreadsheet into a Redis database.

Given a spreadsheet with two headered columns representing a key and a value, tractor-beam will save the key-value pairs to Redis.

## Usage

Install the application using the `go` CLI or download the appropriate binary from the [releases page.](https://github.com/djaustin/tractor-beam/releases)

```bash
go install github.com/djaustin/tractor-beam@latest
```

### One-time Sync

tractor-beam can be used to complete a single synchronisation of the database from a file. 

```bash
tractor-beam sync <spreadsheet-file> <redis-address>
```

```bash
tractor-beam sync Book.xlsx localhost:6379
```

### Watch Mode

Given a spreadsheet file, tractor-beam can continually monitor the file for changes and keep the Redis instance up to date when any changes occur.

```bash
tractor-beam watch <spreadsheet-file> <redis-address>
```

```bash
tractor-beam watch Book.xlsx localhost:6379
```
